§1. Overview
============

The ÔÇô Engine uses an adjusted format for storing raster images. To make this
format accessible to existing tools and workflows, this suite of software has
been commissioned by Arqadium. It features a C-compatible library for use in
other software, and a command-line frontend for general use. We have decided to
licence the command-line frontend under the Mozilla Public Licence 2.0, while
dual-licencing the library code into the public domain or the MIT Licence. See
the COPYING file for details.
